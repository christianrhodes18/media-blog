Brave New World is a brilliant dystopian novel released in 1932 by English author Aldous Huxley. It imagines a future society characterized by technological control, consumerism, and state-imposed happiness. Set in the year 2540 AD (referred to in the book as 632 AF, "After Ford"), the world is governed by a single global state, the World State, which has eradicated war, poverty, and disease but at the cost of individuality and personal freedom. In this future world, human beings are no longer born naturally but are genetically engineered and conditioned for their roles in life, ranging from the highly intelligent ‘Alphas' to the menial labor-performing ‘Epsilons'. The citizens are provided with a drug called ‘soma' that makes its user feel happy and care-free, reinforcing happiness and social order. 

To this day, and in many ways, more than ever, Brave New World remains a powerful and thought-provoking commentary of the potential dangers of technological progress and political power to achieve and maintain an efficient and well-balanced society. 

### Historical Context

Aldous Huxley wrote the now-famous Brave New World in 1931 whilst living in France, and the book was published the following year in 1932. At this time, the world was experiencing the onset of The Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic downturn that lasted a decade. This disturbance to some recent-found strength and prosperity in the economy, specifically in the U.S. and Western Europe, convinced Huxley that stability was the “primal and ultimate need” for civilization. Brave New World explores a possible ‘solution' to this necessity. 

Huxley's experiences in the preceding decade can also be seen in the novel. At some time in the early 1920's, Huxley worked at Brunner and Mond, an advanced chemistry plant. (This influence can be seen in the opening chapter of the book, in which the ‘Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning Centre' is giving some students a tour of their factories.) Sometime around 1925 - 1926, Huxley visited some countries around the world, including the U.S. For some reason, it's noted that he was “outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness, sexual promiscuity and the inward-looking nature of many Americans”. He had a concern that individuality was being sacrificed, an idea that is prominent in Brave New World. It's interesting that these two views he had: viewing ‘stability' as vital for a successful economy and society, and his being “outraged” by a perceived lack of individuality in individuals he encountered during his time in the U.S., commingle into a possible future in which the two work together increasingly to strengthen the other. 

### How Did Things Get This Way? 

One question that comes up when contemplating sci-fi or dystopian novels is: “How did things get so bad?”. Considering that a new era was marked by Henry Ford's assembly line, created in 1913, we know that Brave New World is set in 2540 AD; this is 608 years in the future from publication, or 516 years from the time of writing (2024). A LOT has changed in the last century, and we've seen exponential progress in regards to technology and computing, medicine, transportation, energy, science, and so on. Who is to say what could happen in the next century, let alone the next 5. First of all, it's simply not possible to predict these things as advancements compound and many innovations rely on pre-requisite accomplishments. Imagine trying to predict the 2024 in 1924, or 500 years back in 1524. 

Let's briefly try to envision a path to Brave New World from life in 2024… Let's ask ChatGPT 4 to imagine how this could come to be. Here are the results.

Here's a speculative path from 2024 to the conditions depicted in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," where a single World State governs a highly controlled and engineered society:  

##### 2024-2030: Technological Advancements and Globalization
 
1. **Accelerated Technological Innovation**: Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and genetic engineering. CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies become commonplace, enabling precise control over human genetics.
2. **Global Connectivity**: Enhanced global connectivity through 5G and 6G networks, fostering unprecedented levels of international cooperation and economic interdependence.
3. **Climate Crisis**: Increasing severity of climate change impacts, leading to global environmental regulations and collaborative efforts to mitigate damage.

##### 2030-2040: Sociopolitical Shifts
 
1. **Economic Disparities**: Growing economic disparities and political instability drive many nations towards more centralized, technocratic governance models to ensure stability and control.
2. **Formation of Global Alliances**: Major global powers, facing common threats such as climate change, pandemics, and cyber warfare, form stronger alliances. Organizations like the United Nations gain more authority, evolving into a more unified global government.
3. **Surveillance and Control**: Governments implement advanced surveillance technologies to maintain order. Biometric tracking, AI-driven monitoring systems, and social credit scores become widespread.

##### 2040-2050: Transition to a World State

1. **Technocratic Governance**: Technocrats and AI systems manage essential services and resources globally. National governments increasingly cede power to centralized global authorities.
2. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: To address economic inequalities and job displacement due to automation, a global UBI is introduced, ensuring basic living standards for all.
3. **Population Control**: Governments implement population control measures through incentives for small families and advancements in reproductive technologies.

##### 2050-2070: Genetic Engineering and Social Stability

1. **Genetic Engineering Normalization**: Genetic modification of embryos becomes standard practice to eliminate diseases and enhance desired traits. The social acceptance of eugenics grows.
2. **Mental Health Management**: Psychopharmaceuticals and neuro-enhancement drugs, akin to soma, are developed to manage mental health, ensuring a compliant and content populace.
3. **Cultural Shift**: Traditional family structures and religious practices decline, replaced by state-sanctioned communal living and a culture focused on consumption and pleasure.

##### 2070-2100: The World State

1. **One World Government**: A single World State emerges, governing all regions with uniform laws and policies. Local governments act as administrative units rather than sovereign entities.
2. **Social Stratification**: Society is stratified based on genetically engineered intelligence and physical capabilities. People are conditioned from birth to accept their predetermined roles.
3. **Ubiquitous Soma**: A state-provided drug, similar to soma, is universally consumed to maintain social harmony and suppress dissent. It becomes an integral part of daily life.
4. **Controlled Happiness**: The World State prioritizes stability and happiness through strict control of media, education, and leisure activities, ensuring that citizens remain content and productive.

##### Conclusion  

By 2100, the conditions of Huxley's "Brave New World" have materialized. The World State governs with an iron grip, using advanced technology and psychological manipulation to ensure a stable, uniform society. Individual freedoms are sacrificed for the greater good, and happiness is chemically ensured. The path to this future is paved with both remarkable technological progress and profound ethical compromises, reflecting the complexities and potential dangers of our pursuit of a perfect society.

Now, of course this is incredibly speculative to fit the specific future, and a centralized world state is incredibly difficult to imagine manifesting, but it's a fun thought exercise. I want to dive into one aspect of this future: the technology and technocracy. For fun, I asked ChatGPT a follow up question. That being, “how do you think social media and technology may have an influence on this?”. Here's the response:

Social media and technology would play pivotal roles in shaping the path towards the conditions depicted in "Brave New World." Here's a speculative look at how these elements might influence the development of a single World State and a highly controlled society:

##### Influence of Social Media

1. **Surveillance and Data Collection**: Social media platforms already collect vast amounts of personal data. In a move towards a World State, this data could be leveraged for comprehensive surveillance, tracking individuals' behaviors, preferences, and social connections to ensure compliance and predict dissent.
2. **Behavioral Manipulation**: Algorithms could be designed to subtly influence public opinion and behavior. By controlling the information and narratives that people are exposed to, authorities could shape societal values, promote desired behaviors, and suppress subversive ideas.
3. **Echo Chambers and Polarization**: Social media's tendency to create echo chambers can be exploited to polarize and divide populations initially. However, in a move towards a World State, these divisions could be manipulated to consolidate power by presenting unity and stability under a single governance as the solution to societal strife.
4. **Identity and Privacy Erosion**: The blending of online and offline identities through social media can lead to a significant erosion of privacy. This transparency could be harnessed by a World State to maintain detailed records of every citizen, facilitating control and management of the population.

##### Influence of Technology

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Big Data**: AI and big data analytics could be used to monitor and manage societal trends, predict economic needs, and optimize resource distribution. This would support the World State's goals of stability and efficiency.
2. **Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality**: Advanced VR and AR technologies could create immersive environments for entertainment and education, ensuring that citizens remain engaged and compliant. These technologies could also be used for propaganda, reinforcing state-approved narratives and values.
3. **Biometric and Neurotechnology**: Biometric data (facial recognition, fingerprinting) combined with neurotechnology (brain-computer interfaces, mood regulation devices) would allow the World State to monitor not only physical movements but also emotional and cognitive states, enabling unprecedented levels of control.
4. **Social Credit Systems**: Inspired by existing models like China's social credit system, a global social credit system could be implemented, using data from social media and other tech sources to reward or punish behavior, ensuring conformity to state ideals.

##### Cultural and Psychological Influence

1. **Normalization of Surveillance**: As people become more accustomed to sharing personal information on social media and being monitored by technology, the normalization of surveillance could reduce resistance to more invasive state controls.
2. **Dependency on Technology**: Increasing dependency on technology for everyday activities, communication, and social interaction could make the population more amenable to state control, as the convenience provided by technology outweighs concerns about privacy and freedom.
3. **Digital Distraction**: Social media and technology can serve as tools of distraction, keeping the populace occupied with superficial entertainment and trivial interactions, thereby preventing critical thinking and political engagement.
4. **Community and Identity Shaping**: Online communities can be tailored to promote state-sanctioned identities and values. Technology can facilitate the creation of a homogenized global culture that aligns with the World State's goals.

##### Conclusion  

In this speculative scenario, social media and technology serve as both the tools and the mediums for transitioning towards the World State depicted in "Brave New World." They enable comprehensive surveillance, behavioral manipulation, and cultural homogenization while providing the means to ensure societal stability and control. The integration of these technologies into daily life reduces resistance to state intervention, paving the way for a highly controlled, technologically advanced, and ostensibly utopian society that prioritizes stability and efficiency over individual freedom and diversity.

### Let's Be Realistic, Now

It's hard to predict the future, but it seems very unlikely that any sort of ‘world state' will emerge. What about absolute control within a nation? This seems impossible in any sort of democracy, as a palette of differing viewpoints and solution paths are welcome. Capitalist economies also push back against centralized control, with competition being the beating heart of capitalism. As we've seen in the 21st century, there is certainly an oligopoly with large tech and energy companies, but regulation and the competition law can help counter this, and we are always seeing innovative start-up companies filling gaps in the market. But what about parts of the world that don't operate like this? Well, a natural place the mind may wander to is China. China is a Single-Party, socialist state with authoritarian governance. I would argue that seeing the circumstances of Brave New World are much more likely in a place like China. 

I won't be fully exploring comparisons with Brave New World and different governments and societies in this article, but Huxley's classic dystopian book helps us think with nuance and caution about our future, and it reminds me of our humanity. As John poetically cries, “But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.” May we always keep a piece of John in ourselves, lest we lose our humanity.
