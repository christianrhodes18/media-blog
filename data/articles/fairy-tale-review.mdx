I recently finished reading Stephen King's relatively new novel, Fairy Tale. Written between November 25th, 2020 and February 7th, 2022, Fairy Tale is a fantasy book that stands on its own in King's wonderful mythos. As the title suggests, Fairy Tale was inspired by and represents some classic American fairy tales. King is quick to mention that most of these classics have a more sinister origin, and reminds readers throughout that this story is not the kind of fairy tale that would be told to young children. The reader's relationship with the narrator is unique since the protagonist, Charlie Reade, is writing down his childhood and teenage experience as a memoir story many years after the events of the book take place. This style allows King (or Charlie, rather) to interject author notes in the text that provide a more reliable and high-level comprehension for a given event, piece of dialogue, or character relationship. It's a fun effect that happens infrequently enough so as not to take break the reader's immersion.  

## Spoiler-Free Synopsis

> Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape…
Because within the shed is a portal to another world—one whose denizens are in peril and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the amusement of the “Fair One.” And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time.
A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King's work, *Fairy Tale* is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero's role by circumstance, and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.

## Parts of the Book that Grabbed my Attention and Interest

If you're a fan of King, you should enjoy *Fairy Tale.* It's not horror, per se, but it is inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, so take that how you will. This novel is more in-line with The Dark Tower series, presented in more of a self-contained world (no pun intended). Here were some of my favorites elements:

*Warning: Spoilers*

### The Dark Tower Easter Eggs

When talking about the potential destruction of Empis, Woody, an exiled member of the royal family Gallien, says something originally found in The Dark Tower series:

“Empis… Bella… Arabella… there are other worlds than these, Charlie.” (pg. 497)

This is a quote that hits me like a brick every time I encounter it. It's one of those special moments King masterfully crafts that causes the cup of fantasy and imagination to overflow from the source material and onto the fingers of the reader. It can be a powerful thing. 

### Magic

As Charlie manifests himself as the Promised Prince of Empis, Charlie asks one of his acquaintances from Deep Maleen about the color of his eyes. 

“What do you see? Still hazel?”, Charlie asks. 

Iota leans in to look at Charlie's eyes and responds. 

“Nah. Blue. Bright blue, my prince.”

“Call me Charlie,” Charlie says and shakes out a match. “As for the world I came from… I think all worlds are magic. We just get used to it.” (pg. 499)

This segment of dialogue from late in the book makes the reader question all the things they may have found as strange and alien in the land of Empis - magic, even. This quote makes me recognize how things some might consider to be magic, are taken for granted by others and written off as normal. 

### The Wonderful Illustrations, by Gabriel Rodríguez and Nicolas Delort

Each chapter of *Fairy Tale* is introduced with a title and illustration. This format can be hit or miss with me sometimes, as I like to imagine the world and characters in my own way, but the illustrations found here were really great. They were rather metal. I'll highlight a few below:

P.S. - The chapter 31 illustration is my favorite

### H.P. Lovecraft Influence

These influences are directly mentioned by our Narrator, Charlie. The resemblance goes deeper as the “Deep Well” is mentioned and explored. Unbelievable and otherworldly sights and sounds are endured with awe and horror in equal parts. Some of these dark fantasy elements are a treat for readers familiar with the works of Lovecraft. 

### Managing Anger: Parent-Child Relationships

Not uncommon at all in King's books, our protagonists father is a former alcoholic. Charlie had a hard childhood is can be prone to experiencing anger. I won't go into their relationship in depth here, but something that Charlie reflected on during a confrontation towards the end of the book stood out to me. When being asked not to leave his friends in anger, Charlie decided to accept and forgive. 

“Did I know before then that a person can choose not to be angry? I don't think I did. What I knew was that I didn't want to leave that way, either.” (pg. 579)

This is something an idea you may be familiar with, but it's a good reminder to control your own emotions. It can be a liberating thing for you and those around you. 

### Bonus mention: Radar!

Charlies companion is a sweet German shepherd named Radar. That's the cherry on the top for my recommendation to you to read *Fairy Tale*, if you get the chance!
