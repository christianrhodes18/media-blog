Husband-and-wife team Amber Noizumi and Michael Green created and wrote the original animated series Blue Eye Samurai for Netflix that was released on November 1st, 2023. Blue Eye Samurai tells the tale of Mizu, a half-white half-Japanese samurai born during Japan's Edo period in the 17th century. At this time, Japan's borders were closed on behalf of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. Mizu learns of 4 white men who were in Japan at the time of her birth, and swears to kill each of them. The story thus follows Mizu on her mission, experiencing nameless struggles and adversities, in part from her race and in part from the formidable objective she bears. 

What makes Blue Eye Samurai so unique and special is that it tells the tale of Mizu, a mixed race character, told by hybrid teams with diverse backgrounds. The show is English first, but set in Japan, something that may take some viewers some time to settle into. (It did for me, but the English voice cast is impressive and prestigious, and it feels right to listen this way since the show is not Japan-made). The writers for the show are based in America, working with a French studio, covering Japanese history and culture. The leading stylistic inspiration for the project was Hiroshi Yoshita, a Japanese artist born and raised in Japan, whom also trained in European oils and ended up traveling the world. This hybrid sort of approach can be attributed for the visually striking art style and animation of Blue Eye Samurai, as well as the captivating narrative of a small and taboo group of white men in Japan under the Sakoku, a time in history when Japan was isolated from foreign trade and influence. The show also pays homage to gaming and anime because “without those two genres, you couldn't have a show like this.” (Jane Wu, Supervising Director / Producer)

### Episodic Extremes

Something that makes a show like Blue Eye Samurai so easy to watch and so memorable is the almost self-contained bookending of each episode in the context of the series overarching narrative. This approach is especially pronounced a few episodes in, once the characters are introduced and their motivations are clear. When talking with someone who has also seen this show, I can guarantee that one of you will say something along the lines of: “Remember that episode where …”, or “I loved that one episode when …”. Other shows I think of with a similar longevity include Black Mirror, Love + Death + Robots, and The Sandman. 

Blue Eye Samurai has some remarkable episodes that have a distinct starting point and forthcoming challenge, and end with a clear position on the presented situation (especially episodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 - some of which have won awards for [Best Edited Animated Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Eye_Samurai#Episodes)). As a tightly contained story, the writers present no filler content and are able to pack the series full of exquisite action scenes, emotional flashbacks, and tense rivalries. Mizu teeters the line of hero and anti-hero, and learns something of how following vengeance can set one on the less desirable side of that line.

### A Visual and Aural Treat

French Studio *Blue Spirit* did an incredible job in fulfilling their desire to make the show “look like a moving painting”. It uses a mix of 2D and 3D animation, with the environments and lighting being done in 3D using CGI, and the characters being more superimposed using 2D techniques. Animators would receive storyboards up until the start of an action sequence, and then work from the live-action stunt visuals - choreographed fight sequences led by Sunny Sun, a professional stunt choreographer. There is an in-depth Gnomon video on YouTube featuring many of the people behind the animation and art of Blue Eye Samurai and goes into much more depth for the behind-the-scenes. The animation team even underwent a martial arts class so they could relate to the feelings of throwing a punch or wielding a blade. It was a labor of love from all involved, and results in a stunning, vibrant, avant-garde look and feel. 

The soundtrack was composed by Amie Doherty, an Irish film composer and orchestrator who happens to be the first woman to have scored an animated feature for DreamWorks, that being *Spirit Untamed* in 2021. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find much information about Doherty's writing process, but the Blue Eye Samurai OST is nothing short of spectacular. I can't recommend the track *Melted Metal & Mizu's Rebirth* enough.



The first season of Blue Eye Samurai is streaming on Netflix, and has been renewed for a second season!
