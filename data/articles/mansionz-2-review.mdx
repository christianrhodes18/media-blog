## mansionz Release their Sophomore Album, *mansionz 2*

Six years after their self-titled release, mansionz, a musical partnership between Matthew Musto (blackbear) and Mike Posner, release their much-anticipated sequel album, *mansionz 2*. The two have been good friends as they have had similar careers in a number of ways. Both artists are singer-songwriters, and they are known to be heavily involved in the production of their music. Mike Posner has known pop-star fame with his hits *Cooler Than Me* (2010) and *I Took a Pill in Ibiza* (2015). blackbear has also had several platinum hits, such as *Hot Girl Bummer* (2019), *idfc* (2014), *do re mi* (2017), and *my ex's best friend* (2021), a collaboration with Machine Gun Kelly. Mike and Matthew also co-wrote Justin Bieber's hit song *Boyfriend* (2012) and Mike was credited as the producer alongside grammy-nominated music producer Mason Levy. Dipping in and out of stardom takes it's tolls on creatives, and both artists have had their fair share of struggles with substance abuse, mental health, and the pressures of fame. 

The formation of mansionz in late 2016 was born out of a friendship between the two artists and grew into a special project where they could really be themselves and experiment with their music in new ways. mansionz represents a sort of anti-Hollywood bolstering of who the two artists can be when they don't have to please the industry and can freely flex their talents, and voice their most honest, intimate thoughts and feelings. While much of their individual success has come out of Hollywood and chart-topping, radio hits, success in the music industry is something that has beaten down both artists, necessitating a great redemption arc for the both of them to be good men that lead healthy lives for themselves and those around them. *mansionz 1* was the start of this journey for Mike and Matthew, and *mansionz 2* marks a triumphant summit flag in the mountain of adversity they both faced. 

## The Arc of *mansionz 1* To *mansionz 2*

*mansionz 1* was fun and light-hearted, not trying to be or sound like anything in particular, but it was also authentic and refreshing; something that listeners likely would not have found in either of the artist's individual music. *mansionz 2* is a different beast; It is not a crowd-pleaser by any means. It is weird and more aggressive than *mansionz 1*, but it is also more personal and unashamed. This is something that has resulted in many fans of the first record disliking it's 2023 follow-up, but I think that the fans who support the artists *behind* mansionz will appreciate this mature installment, and very possibly love its music thanks to the arc of these artists and their growth as musicians and people. Mike and Matthew have gone through dark times since 2017, but have struggled through it all to come out the other side with a gratitude to be alive - and to have music, fans, and the opportunity to use their positions to create light and hope in the world on top of that. 

Since *mansionz 1* in 2017, blackbear has gotten married and had two sons (who are featured on the track *Journey of One / omw*), and has battled alcohol and substance addictions and made significant progress in his sobriety. Mike Posner has written and published some poetry, walked across America (during which he survived a rattlesnake bite that nearly killed him), and climbed Mount Everest. Both Matthew and Mike were involved in raising money, Matthew for Cure, a non-profit dedicated to finding a cure for chronic pancreatitis, and Mike for the Detroit Justice Center. 

Blackbear has struggled with substance abuse throughout his life and career, and was hospitalized and diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis in 2016 due to excessive alcohol use. His health complications continued, and he was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis in 2019, which inspired his 2019 hit *Hot Girl Bummer*. Thakfully, Matthew is overall healthy today and has discussed his gratefulness to be alive and 'given a second chance'. He has also been outspoken about his struggles with depression and anxiety. 

Mike Posner struggled to maintain the high of the start of his career - writing and releasing his first ever song, *Cooler Than Me*, from his college dorm to global success. Posner said in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZvNG6ejRk&t=14s) that he had some money in the bank from the success of *Cooler Than Me*, but his “calendar was empty”. In 2015, he was at a low-point, feeling like he threw away his opportunity to have a sustainably successful career as an artist, when he wrote the song *I Took a Pill in Ibiza* which ironically became a hit after a remix of the song came out afterwards by SeeB. Posner went on to focus on philosophy, religion, and overall purpose-seeking over the following years and to this day. He said in [a performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zrweVN4l4) in 2018 that he struggled with the deaths of his father, his friend Avicii, and Mac Miller, all of which affected him personally.

## Root For Your Favorite Artists

We've all seen celebrities, sometimes our heroes, fall victim to various pressures of fame and fortune. We are all human, each with varying situations, influences, opportunities, personalities, etc. At the end of the day, a project like mansionz and an album like *mansionz 2* makes it easy and rewarding for me to root for the individuals behind the music, and to celebrate their successes through the wonderful music on this record. It's a great mix of songs, from acoustic and beautiful, to inspiring testimonies, hyper-aggressive alt/hip-hop/punk ragers, and catchy pop hooks to sing-along to. 

Finally, here are some stand-out lyrics that speak to the growth and passion of Matthew Musto (blackbear) and Mike Posner. 

### Some of my Favorite Lyrics from *mansionz 2*

**Journey of One / omw Lyrics**

(blackbear)

I somehow made it here though

Made it through some years though

Made it through the war, I weighed one hundred thirty soaking wet

Now I'm waking up clear-headed, got my shit together and

Look at both my sons as pieces of my heart I can't forget

The way I love their mother is the kind of love they won't forget

I wanna teach 'em empathy and growth and burning passion

And life ain't 'bout the money or G-Wagons or the fashion

It's making something special with potential and attraction

To what you ﬁnd that's beautiful and what you can imagine

Then making that shit real and really making that shit happen

"On my way back home" is now my favorite fuckin' caption

I love you  

‎

**Stay Alive**

(Mike Posner)

Got a hole in my heart that I tried to ﬁll

With the money and the girls and the molly pill

I called my mom up yesterday

Nothing's really wrong, but I'm not okay

And it rushes in, the memories, the sad thoughts, and everything

I look around and suddenly I almost fade away

Singing cross my heart, I don't hope to die

2018, almost lost my mind

Tell my mother that I'll be ﬁne

Doing my best to stay alive, alive, alive, alive  

‎

**My Invincible Smile**

(blackbear and Mike Posner)

I've been trying to ﬁnd a better way

Than ﬁghting with my demons everyday

But even if they never go away

Still got my invincible smile

When there's a part of me that I forgot

And depression is the only thing I've got

There's still a little light inside of me, that's

My invincible smile

My invincible smile
