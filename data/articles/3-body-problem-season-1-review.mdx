Coming from the creators of HBO's Game of Thrones adaptation, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss pivot from Fantasy to Science Fiction to adapt Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem novel for Netflix. The show jumps between two time periods: one set in the Cultural Revolution of China in the 1960s that explains the origins of the bizarre reality that modern day scientists are faced with in the modern-day period. In modern-day London, and all over the world, scientists are seeing countdowns imprinted in their field of vision demanding that they halt all progress on their scientific work. If they fail to do so, they meet their end with gruesome suicides. Backed by an extremely capable and determined billionaire, detective Clarence Shi is hired to use any means necessary to gather as much information as possible related to these mysterious deaths. His investigation leads him to cross paths with some of the most promising scientists, many of whom also happen to be a group of friends. 

Nothing allows for rich storytelling, both plot-driven and inter-personal, like a strong friend group of intellectually and emotionally intelligent people who are also involved in meaningful work. 3 Body Problem wonderfully balances the existential crises that is the possibility of an impending extinction of the human race with intimate love stories and struggles of one's impact in this world, be it too big or too small. 3 Body Problem really has it all, and it never beats around the bush, wastes your time, or insults your intelligence. That's what I really loved most about this series.

### Competence. Competence. Competence.

One of my favorite aspects of 3 Body Problem is how the writers surround the viewer with interesting, intelligent, and relevant characters. In the context of a scientific pandemic, show me the smartest scientists that have the highest level of expertise in the field, an adept detective who is fully dedicated to his work, a resourceful individual or organization that has humanity's best interest (their survival!) in mind, and finally the antagonists that threaten the protagonists and life itself. Sure, it's convenient that this is who we are ushered through this story with, but it makes for the best viewer experience. One thing I found interesting about the series is the commentary on the futurist vs. conservationist dichotomy: the futurists focusing on technological advancement and the potential for human expansion beyond Earth, and the conservationists emphasizing the need to preserve and protect the environment for future generations. This is a complex and nuanced discussion, but it plays out in fascinating ways under the circumstances presented in 3 Body Problem. 

A great example of this clashing involves lead character Auggie, a genius scientists who invented a revolutionary application for nontech fibers that can be used to achieve remarkable things for humanity, but could be deadly in the wrong hands. When the wealthy intelligence agency chief, Thomas Wade, proposes to use her nontech against the San-Ti's (the alien race interested in relocating to Earth) informants, Auggie is conflicted and initially refuses. She can't imagine taking lives when she doesn't absolutely have to. Wade, however, reminds her that a possible alternative is all of humanity being wiped out (a non-zero possibility). This doesn't make things easier for her, and she chalks Wade up to being a monster. I think this sort of trolly-train problem is intersting, but I personally can't agree with Auggie. I am pro-humanity, and I side with those doing everything they can to protect the lives of our future children. To me, this is admirable. If you've seen the series, what do you think about the two sides at play here? 

Nevertheless, 3 Body Problem has a great sense of urgency that is exhilarating for the viewer, and even hopeful in my opinion, in case some massive threat comes to Earth that requires us to band together and survive. Life has been doing it for millions of years, but could a cosmic threat wipe us out with the wave of a hand?

### Future VR

When some of the core members of the friend group in 3 Body Problem gain access to the San-Ti's VR device, they declare that (the race from another planet that ‚Äúthis is not normal‚Äù, and that the technology is ‚Äúfar beyond the current state of the art‚Äù, suggesting it could be 50 or 150 years ahead of modern technology. The device transports the provides a fully immersive, photo-realistic world that is indistinguishable from reality, except that things can get really, really wild. The device uses some sort of EEG sensor to interact with the brain's activity somehow. This device is used as a very compelling recruiting tool, allowing players who recognize that the game world (a portrayal of the San-Ti's homeworld) exists in a three-body system. Curiosuly, one must be invited to partake in the game. 

It's fascinating that we could achieve realism in a virtual experience. While it seems impossible, they characters may be right about it only being a century away, give or take. Just look at what Epic Games is doing with Unreal, Nvidia with their Digital Twins, and Apple and Meta's work on AR and VR. Great Sci-fi let's us imagine an exciting future, and you know what they say: life imitates art.

### Left with Some Questions

You gotta love science fiction. It stimulates the mind of what could be. I know it's science *fiction*, and you can call me crazy, but I think the chance of something like the events of 3 Body Problem happening in real life is non-zero ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- The San-Ti have achieved faster-than-lightspeed travel. Although their colony will take around 400 years to arrive to Earth, if they were able to send the sophons and the headsets, could there be more San-Ti technology or artifacts on Earth at present time?
- Humanities only chance in defending against the San-Ti and their sophon supercomputers seems to be the fact that the sophon are incabale of reading people's thoughts. However, the headsets are able to tap into the users' brain activity in some capacity. Is it possible that capturing this data is enough to uncover thoughts after all?
- Why were some scientists targeted with countdowns while others were recruited? Was it simply a matter of allegience?
- When the San-Ti receive Earth's signal in the 1960's, I would image they would monitor Earth as closely as possible for signs of life. It seems to me that they likely would have detected this sign eventually had Ye Wenjie not responded when she did.

I can't recommend 3 Body Problem enough. Check it out on Netflix if you love science fiction!
